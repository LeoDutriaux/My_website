abstract: "This study aimed at demonstrating the role of sensorimotor information through the inﬂuence of walking eﬀort perception on the process of route planning for navigation. Participants were asked to walk wearing weighted or non-weighted ankle belts prior to learning virtual environments. They then had to plan routes between land- marks and to estimate travel times and distances for each route. Results newly showed that loaded ankle weights made participants underestimate their own self-reported walking speed compared to the non-loaded partici- pants. In addition, participants with low spatial ability tended to spend more time planning their route when wearing weighted belts than with non-loaded belts. Loaded ankle weights also negatively aﬀected performances on a spatial memory task: landmark position retrieval on a map. These results provide support for embodied views of spatial cognition."
