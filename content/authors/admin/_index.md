I am currently Postdoctoral researcher at the CIMeC, University of Trento, in collaboration with Prof. Roberto Bottini. My research interests include memory, language, spatial cognition, and health cognition from a grounded, embodied, and situated perspective.

My PhD project (supervised by Valérie Gyselinck and Pascale Piolino) aimed to study the involvement of the sensory-motor systems in memory, language, and spatial cognition using motor interference. During my first postdoctoral position with prof. Lawrence Barsalou, I investigated health cognition and, more specifically, how situated conceptualizations contribute to the desire that can motivate behavior, such as eating. My current focus is the neuroscience of spatial cognition.

As a strong supporter of interdisciplinarity I use a wide range of method, from behavior (experiment, surveys) to neuroimaging (EEG, MEG, fMRI).

I also co-developped Neuropsydia, a Python Module for creating experiments, tasks and questionnaires.
