I am currently Assistant Professor at the EMC research group, Université Lumière Lyon 2. 

My research interests include memory, language, spatial cognition, and health cognition from a grounded, embodied, and situated perspective. As a strong supporter of interdisciplinarity I use a wide range of method, from behavior (experiment, surveys) to neuroimaging (EEG, fMRI).

I also co-developped Neuropsydia, a Python Module for creating experiments, tasks and questionnaires.
